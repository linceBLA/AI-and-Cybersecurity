# AI-and-Cybersecurity

### Audience  
This presentation was delivered at the **Consulate of France in Houston** to members of the French expat community. The goal was to offer a clear and accessible introduction to artificial intelligence (AI) while raising awareness about the new types of cyber risks individuals may face as AI becomes more integrated into everyday life.

### Purpose  
The presentation aimed to help participants **understand what artificial intelligence is, how it works, and where it is already present in their daily lives**. Beyond simply informing, it also served as a **warning about the potential misuse of AI in the cybersecurity landscape**, encouraging the audience to be both curious and cautious when interacting with AI technologies.

### Understanding Artificial Intelligence  
The session began with a straightforward explanation of AI, covering its basic definition, how it functions, and the different categories of AI systems. Real-world examples were shared to illustrate AI in action: voice assistants, automatic translation, medical diagnostics, facial recognition, autonomous vehicles, personalized content recommendations, and AI-generated media.

### AI in Cybersecurity: Tool and Threat  
The presentation then explored AIâ€™s role in cybersecurity. On the positive side, AI enhances threat detection, automates responses to attacks, strengthens identity and access management, and improves system monitoring through log analysis. However, it also poses serious risks: AI can be used to create deepfakes, launch automated attacks, generate convincing phishing content, and develop intelligent malware. These examples highlighted how AI can become a tool of manipulation and disruption when misused.

### Responsible Use and Prevention  
The final part of the presentation focused on prevention and best practices. Participants were advised to **never share personal information with AI systems**, to **choose trustworthy platforms**, and to **always verify AI-generated information**, recognizing that AI can make mistakes or be influenced by biased data. The limitations of AI and the importance of critical thinking were emphasized to encourage responsible and informed use.
